                                                        The voice prompts and maps are wonderful especially when driving after dark .\\n0

255w's .\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                           The 750 sounds more like a real female voice, where the 255w sounds more robotic .\\n2                                                                                                                                                                                                  I didn't have the problems with the sounds of the voices like others have .\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Some of the voices are annoying .\\n4                                                                                                                                                                  My understanding is that Garmin really compressed the voice in this unit, far more than in previous units .\\n5                                                                                                                                            I like my older unit better ,  better voice quality and it simply tells you how far to the next turn and what direction to turn .\\n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The quality of the voice   leaves a bit to be desired .\\n7                    The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                      I note that a competitor is coming out with a Homer Simpson version of the GPS voices .\\n9                                                                                                       I wish that the GPS had a remote control that allowed you to change screens without having to lean forward while driving, or better yet, responded to voice commands .\\n10  First I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .\\n11                                                                                     Some of the negatives that were mentioned that I did not find to be true were that you can't understand the voice   The possible list could go on and on but I think you get the idea .\\n12                                                                            The voice is somewhat robotic and some street names are mispronounced, but it's all understandable, I read comments in some reviews that the voice is not loud enough, but I have no problem   .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The text, to, speech is very good, with very clear voices .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You have your choice of several languages and voices .\\n15                                                                                                                                                                      Also, for no extra charge, you are able to download several voices and vehicles from the Garmin site .\\n16                                                                                                                                                                                                                         For instance, you can change the voice of the GPS .\\n17                                                                                                                                                                     The voice descriptions of the routes are clear and easily understood, even for me with a hearing loss .\\n18                                                                                                                                                   At volumes of 60% or above, there is so much distortion that the voices sound like they are coming from a blown speaker .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                  It seems to be caused by Garmin decreasing the file sizes and quality of the voice files .\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                            On previous models like the 350 and 360 the voice files were 100\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                       Its almost impossible to understand the voice as its metallic tinny .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                  Many a times, this is a distraction as you will be wondering what the voice command said .\\n23                                                              Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n24                                                                                                The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And the voice and streets match perfectly .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                   the female voice   is much clearer than Jack, the male American English .\\n27                                                                                                                                              I couldn't understand the Australian or English voices, but Samantha is clear as a bell and can even be heard over the radio .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                       The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .\\n29                                                                                     When the voices are turned up loud enough for my satisfaction, the speakers sound like they are overpowered, making a distorted noise during the loudest parts of the system's voices .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                           It seems that the female voices do not distort quite as much as the male voices .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The voices seem too robotic .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                      However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                 Everybody said the same thing, great unit, but poor voice in the TTS mode .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                    So I called Garmin and ask if any fix was comming out to fix the voice .\\n35

                 Voice commands were mechanical but clear .\\n37

roads .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                    the unit takes you on weird routes and people don't like the TTS voice .\\n40                                                                                                                                                       The user remarks on voice on saying the street name was important to me and easy use of device so too was important .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n42                                                                                                                                                          The default voice is extremely clear and easy to understand, so I never even tried any of the alternative voices .\\n43                                                                                                     I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n44                                                                                                                                     The voice instructions given are clear, but as few people mentioned in their reviews, you need to get familiar with the pronunciation .\\n45                                                                                                                                       Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n46                                                                                                  This is a big help as I was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure I was make correct turns when in Buffalo .\\n47                                                                                                                     Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n48                                                                                                                                                            I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                          I had read about concerns the voice prompts were not loud enough .\\n50                                                    I also love the small things, such as being able to download new voices, and vehicles, I plan on getting all the vehicles has on their site, because there is one for every season, for every mood, every time of year .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                          The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n52                                                                                                                                                      There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                   I agree that the sound isn't great for the TTS voice but it's definitely audible and I like it over all .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The non TTS voice is more pleasant .\\n55                                                                                                                                                  The only complaint that I have if you even want to call it that is that the text, to, speech voices sound pretty robotic .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                              You can also change the voice you hear and your vehicle type .\\n57                                                 The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n58                                                                                                                                                   The unit worked well and I had no issue with the voice as I had my window up all the time and did not have the radio on .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                           I switched over to the male voice which I happen to like better .\\n60                                                    The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n61                                                                                                                          Under the Services link on the Garmin site look for the Goodies section and The Garmin Garage link for extra car images and sometimes voices too .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                   The only complaint I have is that the voice is a little bit tinny especially if the volume is turned up .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                   The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                       The voice it has is clear and readable even for my 79 year old ears .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The voice is clear and easy to understand .\\n67                                                                                                              Since my near vision isn't very good I like the combination of the voice prompts and the big white arrow indicating an approaching turn, especially at night .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0 out of 5 stars No Jill voice on this one !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                      I rated this item with 4 stars because it does not have Jill's voice and there's no way to put it in .\\n70                                                                                                                                            All the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new Samantha voice really sucks big time .\\n71                                           What they did was, they made new voice files a lot smaller that on the previous models and all the new voices sound like crap and there's no way to copy the voices from other devices like you use to with the previous models .\\n72                                                                                                   If you input an address on where you want to go, it tells you how to get there in very clear graphics and also with a computer voice that is not obnoxious to listen to .\\n73                                         I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                          Map is bright and detailed, voice directions are clear and loud  .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice prompts  are mostly clear, sometimes quirky and the volume levels adequate .\\n76

                                                                                                                                                                                   Several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .\\n78                                                                                                                                                                                                                     From reviews, I thought there might only be one voice .\\n79

certain cachet to use the British English female voice that is a standard feature but found that she could not properly pronounce some of the street names in my area .\\n85

a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .\\n87

    The machine has the most comfortable small keyboard I've ever used, because the keys are flat and so the surfaces that your fingerpads touch are actually about the size of standard keyboards

                           The only comparable keyboards I found were those on much larger laptops .\\n29

is generous for a netbook, but I still have some trouble typing on it .\\n33

                                                                                                                        The keyboard isn't quite full sized of course, but very easy to get used to .\\n36                                   I have briefly tried typing on a number of netbooks since last fall, and this is the only one that had a decent keyboard just big enough to accommodate my hands and not result in multiple typing errors .\\n37                                                                                                                                         I have large hands and with a little time on the keyboard I'm breezing through word processing jobs .\\n38                                                                                                                                        I found the ASUS keyboard comfortable to type quickly  it is touch, typeable after brief acclimation .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                             The keyboard, more than 90% standard size, is just large enough .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                I picked it up right away due to the battery life, keyboard and sleek design .\\n41                                                                                                       With such a great battery life, keyboard and responsive touch pad, there's really no other model that can hold a candle to this puppy .\\n42                                                                                                                                      I think the most important thing on these small netbooks is the keyboard, and this one feels very good .\\n43                                                                                                      I notice the tighter keyboard spacing, but it seems easy to type on, yielding no more typing errors than my bad typing normally yields .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,  keyboard feels well laid out\\n45                                                                                                      The keyboard is easy to type on  , the battery life is great, and I've found that I really do like the touch pad with all its features .\\n46                                                                                                   Speaking of which, the keyboard's relatively large size ,  at 92% of the size of a normal one ,  writing longer texts on it is no problem .\\n47                                                                                                                           While I still like the keyboard style of the Toshiba better, the EEE PC has some features that are pretty awesome !\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                     The keyboard doesn't have separation between the keys   .\\n49                                                                                                                                                            I also noticed within the second or third day of use that the keyboard was loose .\\n50                                                                                                                    I found if I pushed down and slid upward in the upper left corner, the keyboard moved up slightly and clicked into place .\\n51                                                                                                                                                           It did not seem to affect the use of the keyboard but it was a slight distraction .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                     The most noticeable difference is the screen and keyboard functionality .\\n53                                                                                                                                                       The cover and screen are glossy and it has a 92% keyboard which is plenty comfortable .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                 Speaking of typing, the keyboard is great, almost full size .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                            The keyboard really works for me .\\n56                                                                                                            It is smaller than a standard keyboard, but after a day or two I got used to it and now I can type pretty fast with few mistakes .\\n57                                                                                                                       I also needed Web connectivity for research, a screen with a low squint factor and a keyboard that wasn't too cramped .\\n58                                                                                                                                 I goosed up the memory to 2G and stuffed a 8G SD memory board in the slot on the right side of the keyboard .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                    The keyboard is just fine for my bony fingers & cruise, on writing speed .\\n60                                                                     And it goes in that bag wrapped in the white paper plastic bag it was originally boxed up in, with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                               1 The keyboard takes a bit of getting used to .\\n62                                                                                                            It's 92% the size of a regular keyboard, and my somewhat larger, than, average male hands have adapted completely in a few weeks .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                                                Small keyboard with some double, function keys\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                          The keyboard is also combortable and not too small .\\n65                                                                                    It is a bit of a pain to unplug and replug power, monitor, LAN, wireless mouse keyboard, hard drive back, up and PDA cable, but not the end of the world .\\n66                                                                           4 And finally the keyboard doesn't stay fastened down at the top it would seem like an easy fix, I've noted it for repair twice and I still have the same problem .\\n67                                                                                                                       1 keyboard still floats  2the screen goes to a solid blue screen either right after starting or after it sits a while .\\n68                                                                                                                                     Great battery life, decent sized screen, and the keyboard was large enough to be comfortable to type on .\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                      Controls for these functions are right on the keyboard .\\n70                                                                                                                                    The keyboard is very useable, I type on it as well as any desktop keyboard this was a must, have feature .\\n71

                                                                                                                     The keyboard took about 20 minutes to get used to, but i'm now typing on it very comfortably .\\n73

                   My advice is to visit a store to personally try the keyboard and screen size .\\n75                                                                                                                                       This was actually the one of the things I feared most, but turns out the keyboard is set up real nice .\\n76

have a nice tactile feel .\\n78                                                                                                                                                                 My favorite part about the Eee PC physically is the keyboard mousepad combo .\\n79                                                                                                                                 The keyboard is excellent and even though only 92% the size of a full size keyboard, feels like the big one .\\n80                                                                                                              I like the feel of the keyboard, and the touchpad software control makes it easy to use without getting in my way while I type .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                                                         The keyboard is just the right size

255w's .\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                           The 750 sounds more like a real female voice, where the 255w sounds more robotic .\\n2                                                                                                                                                                                                  I didn't have the problems with the sounds of the voices like others have .\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Some of the voices are annoying .\\n4                                                                                                                                                                  My understanding is that Garmin really compressed the voice in this unit, far more than in previous units .\\n5                                                                                                                                            I like my older unit better ,  better voice quality and it simply tells you how far to the next turn and what direction to turn .\\n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The quality of the voice   leaves a bit to be desired .\\n7                    The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                      I note that a competitor is coming out with a Homer Simpson version of the GPS voices .\\n9                                                                                                       I wish that the GPS had a remote control that allowed you to change screens without having to lean forward while driving, or better yet, responded to voice commands .\\n10  First I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .\\n11                                                                                     Some of the negatives that were mentioned that I did not find to be true were that you can't understand the voice   The possible list could go on and on but I think you get the idea .\\n12                                                                            The voice is somewhat robotic and some street names are mispronounced, but it's all understandable, I read comments in some reviews that the voice is not loud enough, but I have no problem   .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The text, to, speech is very good, with very clear voices .\\n14

You have your choice of several languages and voices .\\n15                                                                                                                                                                      Also, for no extra charge, you are able to download several voices and vehicles from the Garmin site .\\n16

.\\n17                                                                                                                                                                     The voice descriptions of the routes are clear and easily understood, even for me with a hearing loss .\\n18                                                                                                                                                   At volumes of 60% or above, there is so much distortion that the voices sound like they are coming from a blown speaker .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                  It seems to be caused by Garmin decreasing the file sizes and quality of the voice files .\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                            On previous models like the 350 and 360 the voice files were 100\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                       Its almost impossible to understand the voice as its metallic tinny .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                  Many a times, this is a distraction as you will be wondering what the voice command said .\\n23                                                              Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n24                                                                                                The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And the voice and streets match perfectly .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                   the female voice   is much clearer than Jack, the male American English .\\n27                                                                                                                                              I couldn't understand the Australian or English voices, but Samantha is clear as a bell and can even be heard over the radio .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                       The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .\\n29                                                                                     When the voices are turned up loud enough for my satisfaction, the speakers sound like they are overpowered, making a distorted noise during the loudest parts of the system's voices .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                           It seems that the female voices do not distort quite as much as the male voices .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The voices seem too robotic .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                      However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                 Everybody said the same thing, great unit, but poor voice in the TTS mode .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                    So I called Garmin and ask if any fix was comming out to fix the voice .\\n35

                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Voice commands were mechanical but clear .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I had no problem with the clarity of the voice system .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                    A clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                    the unit takes you on weird routes and people don't like the TTS voice .\\n40                                                                                                                                                       The user remarks on voice on saying the street name was important to me and easy use of device so too was important .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n42                                                                                                                                                          The default voice is extremely clear and easy to understand, so I never even tried any of the alternative voices .\\n43                                                                                                     I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n44                                                                                                                                     The voice instructions given are clear, but as few people mentioned in their reviews, you need to get familiar with the pronunciation .\\n45                                                                                                                                       Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n46                                                                                                  This is a big help as I was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure I was make correct turns when in Buffalo .\\n47                                                                                                                     Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n48                                                                                                                                                            I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n49

enough .\\n50                                                    I also love the small things, such as being able to download new voices, and vehicles, I plan on getting all the vehicles has on their site, because there is one for every season, for every mood, every time of year .\\n51

                                                                                                           There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                   I agree that the sound isn't great for the TTS voice but it's definitely audible and I like it over all .\\n54

                                                                                                                             The only complaint that I have if you even want to call it that is that the text, to, speech voices sound pretty robotic .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                              You can also change the voice you hear and your vehicle type .\\n57                                                 The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n58                                                                                                                                                   The unit worked well and I had no issue with the voice as I had my window up all the time and did not have the radio on .\\n59

screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n61                                                                                                                          Under the Services link on the Garmin site look for the Goodies section and The Garmin Garage link for extra car images and sometimes voices too .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                   The only complaint I have is that the voice is a little bit tinny especially if the volume is turned up .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                   The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .\\n65

                                                                                                                                                                                                              The voice is clear and easy to understand .\\n67                                                                                                              Since my near vision isn't very good I like the combination of the voice prompts and the big white arrow indicating an approaching turn, especially at night .\\n68

because it does not have Jill's voice and there's no way to put it in .\\n70                                                                                                                                            All the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new Samantha voice really sucks big time .\\n71                                           What they did was, they made new voice files a lot smaller that on the previous models and all the new voices sound like crap and there's no way to copy the voices from other devices like you use to with the previous models .\\n72                                                                                                   If you input an address on where you want to go, it tells you how to get there in very clear graphics and also with a computer voice that is not obnoxious to listen to .\\n73                                         I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n74

                        The voice prompts  are mostly clear, sometimes quirky and the volume levels adequate .\\n76

will announce both directions and street names, etc .\\n78

certain cachet to use the British English female voice that is a standard feature but found that she could not properly pronounce some of the street names in my area .\\n85

a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .\\n87

                               The keyboard is quite nice and I have very large hands and I make a lot fewer mistakes .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                    The fit and finish are very good, no gaps and I like the keyboard layout .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The keyboard is easy to use .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                       The keyboard has a decent feel but seems more cramped than the 1005ha .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                         Definitely the best looking netbook, and possibly the best keyboard .\\n15                                                           The keyboard is not quite perfect, the screen doesn't tilt back as far as I'd like, slightly higher resolution in the screen would be nice a new model not yet available in the U .\\n16                                                                                                                                                                   The keyboard, though slightly smaller than standard, is a pleasure to use .\\n17                                                                                                                                                                                          The keyboard is terrific, solid feel and full size .\\n18                                                                                                                                          The touchpad feels great, the boot up was fast, keyboard feels comfortable, and the screen is good .\\n19                                                                                                                                               The keyboard is REALLY easy to get used to, possibly the best netbook keyboard I've ever used .\\n20                                                                                                                                                             It was easy to set up, and I really liked the comfort of the mouse and keyboard .\\n21                                              The machine has the most comfortable small keyboard I've ever used, because the keys are flat and so the surfaces that your fingerpads touch are actually about the size of standard keyboards .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                         The keyboard and mouse are my biggest concern for the tiny computer .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                        The keyboard is functional, but takes a little bit of getting use to .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                      Build quality is great, love the touchpad and keyboard .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                 Keyboard is not as sturdy as I would like has some minor flex\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                  keyboard is actually a pleasure to use inspite of small size\\n27                                                                                                                                                                              Well, I'm a touch typist and very particular about my keyboard .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                     The only comparable keyboards I found were those on much larger laptops .\\n29                                                                                                                                                                                                          My keyboard also seems a bit noisy .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                         However, two weeks in, the keyboard would sporadically stop working .\\n31                                                                                                                       The build quality is very good, and the keyboard, though small, is surprisingly comfortable and has good key response .\\n32                                                                                                                                                          The keyboard is generous for a netbook, but I still have some trouble typing on it .\\n33                                                                                                                                                 They keyboard takes some getting used to, but even still, I could not write a novel on this .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                       Keyboard feels funny at first, but you get used to it .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                 The keyboard isn't quite full sized of course, but very easy to get used to .\\n36                                   I have briefly tried typing on a number of netbooks since last fall, and this is the only one that had a decent keyboard just big enough to accommodate my hands and not result in multiple typing errors .\\n37                                                                                                                                         I have large hands and with a little time on the keyboard I'm breezing through word processing jobs .\\n38                                                                                                                                        I found the ASUS keyboard comfortable to type quickly  it is touch, typeable after brief acclimation .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                             The keyboard, more than 90% standard size, is just large enough .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                I picked it up right away due to the battery life, keyboard and sleek design .\\n41                                                                                                       With such a great battery life, keyboard and responsive touch pad, there's really no other model that can hold a candle to this puppy .\\n42                                                                                                                                      I think the most important thing on these small netbooks is the keyboard, and this one feels very good .\\n43                                                                                                      I notice the tighter keyboard spacing, but it seems easy to type on, yielding no more typing errors than my bad typing normally yields .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,  keyboard feels well laid out\\n45                                                                                                      The keyboard is easy to type on  , the battery life is great, and I've found that I really do like the touch pad with all its features .\\n46                                                                                                   Speaking of which, the keyboard's relatively large size ,  at 92% of the size of a normal one ,  writing longer texts on it is no problem .\\n47                                                                                                                           While I still like the keyboard style of the Toshiba better, the EEE PC has some features that are pretty awesome !\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                     The keyboard doesn't have separation between the keys   .\\n49                                                                                                                                                            I also noticed within the second or third day of use that the keyboard was loose .\\n50                                                                                                                    I found if I pushed down and slid upward in the upper left corner, the keyboard moved up slightly and clicked into place .\\n51                                                                                                                                                           It did not seem to affect the use of the keyboard but it was a slight distraction .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                     The most noticeable difference is the screen and keyboard functionality .\\n53                                                                                                                                                       The cover and screen are glossy and it has a 92% keyboard which is plenty comfortable .\\n54

keyboard is great, almost full size .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                            The keyboard really works for me .\\n56                                                                                                            It is smaller than a standard keyboard, but after a day or two I got used to it and now I can type pretty fast with few mistakes .\\n57                                                                                                                       I also needed Web connectivity for research, a screen with a low squint factor and a keyboard that wasn't too cramped .\\n58                                                                                                                                 I goosed up the memory to 2G and stuffed a 8G SD memory board in the slot on the right side of the keyboard .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                    The keyboard is just fine for my bony fingers & cruise, on writing speed .\\n60                                                                     And it goes in that bag wrapped in the white paper plastic bag it was originally boxed up in, with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen .\\n61

                                                     It's 92% the size of a regular keyboard, and my somewhat larger, than, average male hands have adapted completely in a few weeks .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                                                Small keyboard with

                The keyboard is also combortable and not too small .\\n65                                                                                    It is a bit of a pain to unplug and replug power, monitor, LAN, wireless mouse keyboard, hard drive back, up and PDA cable, but not the end of the world .\\n66                                                                           4 And finally the keyboard doesn't stay fastened down at the top it would seem like an easy fix, I've noted it for repair twice and I still have the same problem .\\n67                                                                                                                       1 keyboard still floats  2the screen goes to a solid blue screen either right after starting or after it sits a while

large enough to be comfortable to type on .\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                      Controls for these functions are right on the keyboard .\\n70                                                                                                                                    The keyboard is very useable, I type on it as well as any desktop keyboard this was a must, have feature .\\n71

                                                                                                                     The keyboard took about 20 minutes to get used to, but i'm now typing on it very comfortably .\\n73

                   My advice is to visit a store to personally try the keyboard and screen size .\\n75                                                                                                                                       This was actually the one of the things I feared most, but turns out the keyboard is set up real nice .\\n76

have a nice tactile feel .\\n78                                                                                                                                                                 My

weak, and keyboard is cramped, but this is the case for other netbooks at this price point .\\n84

                                                            Due to the size of netbooks and a wide screen format, the screen should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n87

the side scroll area easily .\\n106

                                            Productivity wasn't a huge benefit, but I did feel the keyboard was a major selling point for the extra dough .\\n109

                                  I mostly find that when I make typos, it's not because of the keyboard, it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .\\n124                                                   A lot of netbooks on the market have mangled the keyboard in one way or another such that if you are a touch typist, you find yourself hitting the wrong key often, which is frustrating .\",\n          \"

                                        As for the video camera it's a nice addition considering it's an mp3 player first and foremost, I think people are going to go into this and think maybe I can

necessary evil in order to tag say a video as music and not a movie, so though i originally started with 3rd party apps for syncing i have since switched to itunes .\\n25

noticing transmission surge during 2nd and 3rd gear during first few minutes of driving .\\n5     The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n53

mentioned rather small ,  see the photos, literally just enough room to walk between the bed and the dressing table desk, but so long as you are not intending to spend much time in there you will be OK .\\n245

which I think is rediculous .\\n60                                                                                                                                            There were no king rooms available when we checked in and the woman at the front desk was not overly helpful until we produced a copy of our confirmation wtih the king bed request on it .\\n61

                                 We even got upgraded to one of the corner rooms   which also looked west toward Michigan Ave and the Wrigley building .\\n67

as the building rises the noise will get worse as they get closer to guest rooms .\\n68

      The interior of the guest rooms is decidedly generic, lacking the style of some of Chicago's newer hotels   .\\n91

with all the essentials of a business hotel .\\n92

  It could be an excellent property if the rooms were updated with new mattresses, televisions and desks .\\n94

few rooms with a view but not many .\\n95                                                                                                                                                                                      Suspecting the rooms were allocated under the control of large travel agencies, I immediately called a friend and had them book me using hotels .\\n96                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          These rooms are right next to the elevators .\\n97

the bathrooms are very nice .\\n98                                                                                                                                                                                                                    For 2 nights there were 4 of us and for the last night only 2, so I was looking for 2 rooms or a room with 2 beds .\\n99                                                                                                                                        I originally booked 2 rooms because their online reservation site would only allow you to book a room for 1, 3 people and there was no guarantee that you would get a room with 2 double beds .\\n100                                                                                                                                the service staff always left our rooms clean, and even arranged my girlfreinds jewelry for her, untangling her necklaces and earrings from each other, and leaving them evenly placed on the bureau !\\n101

downtown Chicago standards .\\n104

                  The rooms and common areas were bland and far from a top flight hotel .\\n106

near a 4 5 star hotel .\\n107                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I would say the best part about this hotel was that it was very very quiet from inside the rooms .\\n108                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The decor of the rooms and the communal areas is really dated, looks like it hasn't been touched for years .\\n109                                                                                                                                                               The Swissotel was a great place to stay, rooms were very clean, and quiet at night for a great nights rest, with extremely comfortable beds, and high quality bedding .\\n110                                                                                                                 We had a pretty bad view on the 27th floor relative to the other rooms which faced Lake Michigan   There's some construction right now Southwards and we stared at a giant mud pit with big cranes the entire visit .\\n111                                                                                                                                               So, in all, I would definitely stay hereagain, even though the service stinks, the restaurantis for rich patrons with money to blow and the peopleare snobs, the rooms make up for it .\\n112                                                                                                                  Some of the other hotels in the same class in Chicago might be a little more decorative or chic but their rooms are not as comfortable and don\\u0092t seem to have the same dependable amenities that the Swissotel has .\\n113                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Rooms were good, nothing spectacular about them except the views .\\n114                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The beds were extremely comfortable, rooms were extremely spacious and the bathrooms were as well .\\n115                                                                                                                                           We didn't check out the normal rooms but my parents were in a &quot normal&quot  room and loved it, and said it was one of the nicest and most importantly cleanest they'd been in lately .\\n116                                                                                                                                                       From talking to other guests, I concluded that rooms ending with numbers xx1, xx2, xxx19 and xx20 should be avoided unless you enjoy listening to elevators going up and down !\\n117                                                                                                                                                                                                                  One thing that struck me as backward is that they charge $10 per 24 hours of internet usage in certain guest rooms .\\n118                                                                                                                                                                          I pointed out to the manager that my firm held a conference there just months before and had used the conference facilities as well as several hotel rooms .\\n119                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Honestly, I would rate the service and location a three, the rooms a four, and the view a five !\\n120

maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n38

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            There is virtually no counterspace in the bathroom at all .\\n42

bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43



                                                                                                                                                     The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to

had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

different room .\\n63

preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle

                                                        The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72

us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .\\n77

endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n4

cheaper by $25 and they told me that I needed to buy a memory card to download map updates .\\n6                                                                                                                                         Another big name site did the same thing and told me that I would have to pay Garmin to update to the latest maps .\\n7                                                                                 The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n8                                                                              Finally, be carefull around Washington DC, because this unit has not updated the actual and latest detours arownd monuments and buildings, therefore taking you to dead ends .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                                      This clearly shows how often the map updates even when sitting still .\\n10                                                                                                                           Upon plugging my Nuvi 255w in the PC for the first time, it immediately informed me of both a software update and a map update .\\n11

                                         The map update was about 2GB in size .\\n13                                                                                                                  I have Comcast cable Internet and a quad, core PC with 4gb of ram and the map update took a little over an hour to download and install .\\n14

         It can be done by phone but if you do it that way you don't get the one free update on the maps .\\n35

box, and when the GPS shows that it is acquiring signals   don't skip that .\\n38                                                                                                         I also like the fact that Garmin makes the most recent map updates available   rather than leave users hanging like some other GPS manufacturers .\\n39

is a handy little device that provides excellent value, but more importantly spot on directions .\\n6                                                 While I recommend that you refrain from entering a directions request while driving your car, I note that some of the more impressive features of this GPS are literally one touch away, and so mounting the device close enough to you to activite a one touch feature would seem to be relatively important .\\n7                                                                                                       But leaving it on the seat next to you is likely to cause a few double takes because as comfortable as you think you're going to be just listening for directions, the fact remains that the graphics will attract your eyeballs like a moth to a flame .\\n8

     but for the most part, we find that the Garmin software provides accurate directions, whereever we intend to go .\\n10                                                                                                                                         Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n11

directions when it isn't necessary .\\n12                                                                                                                                       The only other annoyance of any time is that if you deviate from your route and don't indicate that you are detouring, you get to hear the Garmin repeatedly chastize you because it has to recalulate your directions .\\n13

like the highway sign says, or like I would verbally tell someone to take if giving them directions .\\n33

can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n34

entertaining and not an issue .\\n39

would be its inability to show 1, way streets on your overhead map   and that this particular model does not support the Garmin routing feature that you can sync between your PC and their more expensive models to pick multiple waypoints instead of just a point 'A' to point 'B' directions system .\\n42

and Google Maps has features that work with Garmin units .\\n43                                                                                                                                         Any time you're facing a closed roadway or are terribly stuck in highway traffic, you'll get a very slick change in directions to your destination given to you in literally less than 5 seconds than you ask for it .\\n44

                                                    The purpose of the GPS is to give me directions in unfamiliar locations .\\n46

         The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                 It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I had a great time torturing the poor thing and deliberately not following its directions while driving one day in downtown Sacramento .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As with the 285WT, it gave me bad directions in one place in Sacramento .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                     I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                        I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                        Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The directions were pretty right on, with a brief glitch with the distance it was calculating for some approaching streets .\\n55

boasts, but for basic travel directions for the non, techie then this is a great product .\\n56

mapping Web site and recite the directions .\\n57                                                                                                                   Daughter Dearest now carries the Nuvi in the glove box of her car, pulling it out, plugging it in, and getting directions whenever she needs, in a manner that notably is much faster and clearer than reading a map or calling her mother .\\n58

                                                                                                                                                                                                        There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n60

bought the first one for my wife since she needs directions alot of the time .\\n61

were following me for directions .\\n62

                                                                                                                             The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n64

which I chose for its ability to adjust the directions if you reroute, text to speech feature and 4 .\\n65

took a roadtrip with no  squabbling  about directions .\\n66

seconds .\\n67

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I was so tired of having to go to Mapquest and print out directions .\\n69

fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n70

directions with amazing accuracy .\\n71

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The directions the GPS gave me were absolutely correct  , but the name of the highway was wrong .\\n73                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wish I had bought it about two years ago rather than spend a lot on maps and wasting time asking directions, especially in relatively remote areas of ME .\\n74

around the Mid, West following Mapquest maps and directions .\\n75                                                                                                                                             I chose small towns as destinations and it always led me there without any problems, thus allowing me to enjoy the scenery of the fall foliage without worrying about using a map for directions or getting lost .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I use the map feature when I don't need directions which makes it easier to identify streets when street signs are obscured or missing  .\\n77

                              It can be a little distracting the first few times you use it, but once you find the right mounting spot, it s like it's not there until you need it and then it's there

when necessary .\\n94                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   But driving on the highway with music on and windows down, it will be hard to hear the directions using just 70% of volume .\\n95

seemed a bit confused in directions .\",\n          \"

layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .\\n4          The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n5                                                                                The widescreen is a plus and I highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .\\n6

odometer screen that will allow you to track all sorts of data about your long car trip .\\n9                                                                                                                                             It tells you on the main screen your estimated time of arrival which will change depending upon your stops and speed .\\n10

fasscinating .\\n11                                            Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n12

way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .\\n15                                                    Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n16                                                                                      The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n17                                                                                    On the other hand, after about a week of using the Garmin, it seems to understand where we are, and now POIs as far as 25 miles away will show up when the screen is touched .\\n18

that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .\\n26                                                                                                                                                               If you missed the spoken directions, you can look at the top of the

doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n28

map .\\n33                                                                                                                         The extra features of the 255W over lesser models that I find highly beneficial include spoken street names and the wide screen display .\\n34

                            I use the suction cup mount because I like to keep the screen in my frame of vision without turning my head, but I make sure to take it with me when I park my car .\\n36                                                                                                                                                             From the map screen it's but 2 presses on the large and accessible touchscreen to get a  Where Am I ?\\n37    I also realize that even if I crashed differently I had been injured in other ways but the car were still drivable that it's but 1 press on the screen to get direction to the nearest emergency services   from that lovely screen that told me where I was .\\n38

possibility of it sliding out .\\n43                                                                                                                                             Also, it's hard to view the screen when it's super sunny outside, but the text to speech capability is an advantage .\\n44

                                                        These gadgets have sensitive touchscreen menus, and I think the fact that I didn't protect the screen on my last GPS is the reason it died after only 14 months .\\n46

screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n50                                                                                                                                        The local  speed limit  is shown on left side of the screen with current driving speed shown at the bottom of the screen .\\n51

was also great since I was in unfamiliar territory .\\n53                                                                                                                                     I watched the screen several times as I passed by a speed limit sign, and it would change almost immediately as I passed by !\\n54                                  I was afraid the screen on one of these things would be too small for me to see, and the last thing I need would be futzing around with a GPS screen when I'm on the road if I wanted to do that, I could drive and read a map !\\n55

huge next to some of the units I saw .\\n56                                                                                                                                                  I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                               It has a very clear and bright screen and is loaded with multiple useful features .\\n58                                                                                                                                                              It has a great screen presentation that is very easy to read when it is mounted on your windshield .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                         3 inch screen was a slight improvement over my former 3 .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                              The screen is large so that it is easily read while you're driving .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                              The wide screen and spoken street names are a must .\\n63                                                             If I'm listening to loud music, I won't be able to hear the exact words but I can hear it vaguely and that is a cue that I should glance down at the top of the screen and see what my next move is .\\n64                                                                                                                                                     There should be an external volume control on the unit, or at least volume control from the main map screen .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                         The posted speed limit on the screen is pretty cool too .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Also, push every icon on every screen you see .\\n67                                                                                                                             In both instances this could have been avoided if I had just paid attention to the screen which showed the correct road highlighted .\\n68                                                                                                                                                    The dashboard mount keeps the unit easily within reach so that you can safely touch the screen while driving .\\n69                                                                                            Was thinking about buying the 265WT for only $45 more, but decided I didn't need bluetooth or the Traffic Feature which gives you flash advertisements on the screen .\\n70                                                                                                                         Those are the only 2 differences between the 2 models and I'd rather not have flash advertisements coming up on my GPS screen at random .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                            3 Inch screen is awesome to look at both during the day and at night .\\n72                                       The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n73                                          The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is big enough to view maps, street names, etc easily .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Sufficiently sensitive touch screen\\n76                                                                                                                                                          Now if Garmin would put a compass on the main screen always pointing to the north, it would be perfect .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                             We love the spoken street names and the wide screen .\\n78                                                                                                                                                           The 255w does not have a convenient volume control  you must go through the menu system on the screen .\\n79                                                                                                                                                                                       The screen size makes it really easy to see without being a safety hazard .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                    The background of the screen turns black when it's nighttime .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                       The user must get into a few layers of the menu to access the touch screen volume control .\\n82

.\\n84                                                                                                                                                3 inches large screen is large enough for you to

                                       One down side is the lack of volume button on the unit you have to adjust the volume form the tool menu on the screen which can be a challenge if you want to change the volume when you are driving .\\n91                                                                                                                                                After lots of internet research, we settled on the Garmin 255W for the text, to, speech and wide screen features .\\n92

                                                                                                                                                                    The wide screen is important because of the better keyboard   .\\n94                                                                                                                                                  We started with a non, touch screen which was great, then we updated to the streetpilot C330 which was a dream .\\n95                                                                                                                                                After ample research   I selected the Nuvi 255W for it's abundant features, wider screen and voice communication .\\n96

larger screen .\\n97

so much easier than doing the same with a full size notebook or even the 700m .\\n6

not want it to do so .\\n8

                                        It's the perfect size and weight to take almost anywhere .\\n12

fingerpads touch are actually about the size of standard keyboards .\\n13   It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n14

an external, which I have .\\n21                                                                                                                                        Small, easy to grab and go, and can do your business in places that wouldn't open a full size laptop, easy to take notes on, or keep copies of what your working on from your main PC and continue working on it where ever you are

be usable .\\n28

keyboard's relatively large size ,  at 92% of the size of a normal one ,  writing longer texts on it is no problem .\\n31

compressed size of the UP and DOWN arrows, but I suppose that was probably unavoidable .\\n32

sure you're ok with the size .\\n34

although the screen is relatively small to my eyes   it wasn't really hard to get used to the size and the screen is clear and bright, no prob reading articles and writing essays .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          One of the things that I found difficult to get used to is the size of the screen .\\n50

  and a little wired Logitech notebook mouse sucks like all mice but usable if a mouse is your idea of a good time .\\n51

fan pad that folds up to about the size of the closed netbook and runs off a USB port .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is very sharp and readable even with the tiny text at this size .\\n53

full size laptop or desktop .\\n54                                                                                                                                                      The small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop, the long battery life is really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The keyboard is excellent and even though only 92% the size of a full size keyboard, feels like the big one .\\n56

the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n60

                                      It seems as though this is due to the small size of the unit, it doesn't have enough room to dissipate the heat .\\n63

                         I was worried the screen size would be too small and uncomfortable to read, but it has been great for everything I run :\\n70

the feel of typing on it, and have not had any issues transferring from a regular, sized keyboard to a smaller one .\\n71                                                                                                                                             I was also worried that it's small size would equate to something delicate, but I am rough on my electronics, and the ASUS has handled a few rough tousles with textbooks in a bag slung into my car seat without any problems .\\n72

but it is adequate for the type of things I use it for .\\n73                                                                                                                                         As soon as you connect the VGA cable to an unknown projector and press the function key for projection, it automatically adjusts the size and resolution to fit the projector even if it cannot display properly on its own screen .\\n74

                The screen is easily readable in the sun, and I love how it automatically dims to 20% at night .\\n3                                                                Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .\\n4          The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n5                                                                                The widescreen is a plus and I highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .\\n6

                                                                                                                                            If you are looking for a simple wide screen GPS the Nuvi 255W is the right choice .\\n8                                                                                                                    One of my favorite features on the Garmin 255W is the odometer screen that will allow you to track all sorts of data about your long car trip .\\n9                                                                                                                                             It tells you on the main screen your estimated time of arrival which will change depending upon your stops and speed .\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                         Additionally, I find the data in the odometer screen to be fasscinating .\\n11                                            Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                         ,  255w has an arrow at the top of the screen that shows the direction of the next turn .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                        To make things worse, in the the  Main st  may not be on the screen on the default scale .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                                 The way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .\\n15                                                    Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n16                                                                                      The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n17                                                                                    On the other hand, after about a week of using the Garmin, it seems to understand where we are, and now POIs as far as 25 miles away will show up when the screen is touched .\\n18                                                                                                                                                                             The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .\\n19

the map, you can zoom in or out by tapping the appropriate icon located on the top right of the screen .\\n25                                                                           I have noticed that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .\\n26                                                                                                                                                               If you missed the spoken directions, you can look at the top of the screen for written directions .\\n27                                                                                                                                               So, although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n28

                            I use the suction cup mount because I like to keep the screen in my frame of vision without turning my head, but I make sure to take it with me when I park my car .\\n36

the screen when it's super sunny outside, but the text to speech capability is an advantage .\\n44                                                                                                                         Before I get into the specifics of my review, let me offer one important piece of advice , ,  BUY A CARRYING CASE to protect the screen !\\n45                                                                                                 These gadgets have sensitive touchscreen menus, and I think the fact that I didn't protect the screen on my last GPS is the reason it died after only 14 months .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                             I had a Nuvi 205 and I really liked it but I wanted a bigger screen .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                 It's an emergency location feature ,  you can tap the screen to get your latitude and longitude .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                       BUT, in direct sunlight, the screen is difficult to see in my convertible .\\n49                                                                                                                             Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n50                                                                                                                                        The local  speed limit  is shown on left side of the screen with current driving speed shown at the bottom of the screen .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                    One thing that would be useful is putting a mute button on the screen available at all times .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                 Having the speed limit show up on the screen was also great since I was in unfamiliar territory .\\n53                                                                                                                                     I watched the screen several times as I passed by a speed limit sign, and it would change almost immediately as I passed by !\\n54                                  I was afraid the screen on one of these things would be too small for me to see, and the last thing I need would be futzing around with a GPS screen when I'm on the road if I wanted to do that, I could drive and read a map !\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                              The screen is huge next to some of the units I saw .\\n56                                                                                                                                                  I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                               It has a very clear and bright screen and is loaded with multiple useful features .\\n58                                                                                                                                                              It has a great screen presentation that is very easy to read when it is mounted on your windshield .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                         3 inch screen was a slight improvement over my former 3 .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                              The screen is large so that it is easily read while you're driving .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                              The wide screen and spoken street names are a must .\\n63                                                             If I'm listening to loud music, I won't be able to hear the exact words but I can hear it vaguely and that is a cue that I should glance down at the top of the screen and see what my next move is .\\n64                                                                                                                                                     There should be an external volume control on the unit, or at least volume control from the main map screen .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                         The posted speed limit on the screen is pretty cool too .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Also, push every icon on every screen you see .\\n67                                                                                                                             In both instances this could have been avoided if I had just paid attention to the screen which showed the correct road highlighted .\\n68                                                                                                                                                    The dashboard mount keeps the unit easily within reach so that you can safely touch the screen while driving .\\n69                                                                                            Was thinking about buying the 265WT for only $45 more, but decided I didn't need bluetooth or the Traffic Feature which gives you flash advertisements on the screen .\\n70                                                                                                                         Those are the only 2 differences between the 2 models and I'd rather not have flash advertisements coming up on my GPS screen at random .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                            3 Inch screen is awesome to look at both during the day and at night .\\n72                                       The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n73                                          The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is big enough to view maps, street names, etc easily .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Sufficiently sensitive touch screen\\n76                                                                                                                                                          Now if Garmin would put a compass on the main screen always pointing to the north, it would be perfect .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                             We love the spoken street names and the wide screen .\\n78                                                                                                                                                           The 255w does not have a convenient volume control  you must go through the menu system on the screen .\\n79                                                                                                                                                                                       The screen size makes it really easy to see without being a safety hazard .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                    The background of the screen turns black when it's nighttime .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                       The user must get into a few layers of the menu to access the touch screen volume control .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                                              Screen is clear and maps are pretty easy to follow .\\n83                                                                                                                                           I look at the direction line at the top bar of the screen to make sure I understand what the verbal instructions were .\\n84                                                                                                                                                3 inches large screen is large enough for you to

                       If money is your leading consideration, then one of these may be for you, but for just a bit more money you get a much better screen, better battery life, bigger drive, more

me, and it's not too bad of a fingerprint magnet .\\n33

                                    Some iTunes content is a little laggy if it is maximized display, but not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .\\n35

            It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n37

glare, or move the lamp .\\n45



                             And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .\\n49

                                     and I could have gotten a matte screen, but neither of those  features  impressed me .\\n50

once on the screen, the Asus satisfies my needs and seems about as fast as my 5, year, old IBM laptop .\\n51

image on the computer screen  shivered , although it normally recovered from that .\\n52

            I like the gloss screen fine .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is too small for any meaningful work, but the apps DO work .\\n55

.\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             like others have said, it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the glossy screen can be a bit of a problem in some lighting conditions .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I received my Asus 1005HA yesterday installed the two gb ram and tried to turn it on and the screen remained blank .\\n58

phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural .\\n143                                                                                                                                               But even with that, and the glossy screen, fingerprint magnet, limited screen tilt, tinny speakers, and intermittent odd glitches, I still think it's a great value and would buy it again today if I were on the market for a netbook .\\n144

        I have not accidentally knocked it over, but I think it could easily be done  the screen is glossy   .\\n153

displayed on the netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since it's a  chopped  1024 x 600 height screen, instead of the more usual 786 .\\n162

and even one line of a large order maintenance screen can require you to have to break the flow of productivity to scroll .\\n163

               Because the screen is so small in order to get the standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .\\n169

mostly find that when I make typos, it's not because of the keyboard, it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .\\n171
